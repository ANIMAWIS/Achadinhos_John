Achadinhos_John-main Project Report

Date: February 24, 2026

Workspace structure:
- index.html (main site)
- achadinhosj/index.html (duplicate site?)
- css/style.css, achadinhosj/css/style.css
- js/script.js, achadinhosj/js/script.js
- admin.html (administrative page)

Description:
Static website for displaying product offers pulled from a Google Sheets spreadsheet. The page loads data via fetch from a public URL (CSV or gviz JSON) and renders cards. Includes search, sorting, and filtering by store/category/price. A mobile-friendly menu and filter panel were implemented.

Key features:
- Dynamic product loading from Google Sheets (CSV or gviz JSON)
- Parse utilities for CSV and gviz formats
- Normalization and mapping of spreadsheet columns
- UI rendering with filtering, searching, and sorting
- Admin area with password prompt ("Batatadoce") that loads the sheet in an iframe and a preview of index.html
- Optionally, an Apps Script integration was discussed to post new entries automatically (code provided but later removed per user choice)
- Responsive CSS with animations and card effects
- Navigation hamburger toggle for mobile

Development level: Beginner to intermediate front-end. No backend; all logic in vanilla JavaScript. Suitable for learning HTML/CSS/JS and integrating with simple external data sources.

Usage instructions:
1. Open index.html in a browser.
2. Modify SHEET_URL constant in js/script.js to point to desired spreadsheet (use export CSV or gviz endpoint).
3. In the admin area, click "Área Admin" and enter the password to view and edit the sheet.
4. (Optional) Share spreadsheet publicly to allow iframe access.

Customization notes:
- Admin page can display any other iframe or add forms.
- Apps Script snippet previously provided allows automatic insertion of rows.
- The structure is duplicative in the achadinhosj subfolder; can be consolidated.

Dependencies: None external except Font Awesome CDN for icons.

File modifications log:
- script.js: Updated SHEET_URL, added admin button listener.
- index.html: Added admin button and CSS styling.
- admin.html: Created page, later simplified to just iframe and preview.
- style.css: Added admin button styles and filter/site styles.
